# Aggregate STAR Gene Counts
#
# This script reads all 'ReadsPerGene.out.tab' files from a specified directory,
# selects the appropriate count column based on library strandedness, and
# merges them into a single, analysis-ready count matrix.

# Author: [Seu Nome/Laborat√≥rio]

# Usage:
#   ./aggregate_counts.R <star_counts_dir> <count_column> <output_file.tsv>
#
# Example:
#   ./aggregate_counts.R ./results/05_aligned_reads 4 ./results/06_final_counts/final_counts.tsv
