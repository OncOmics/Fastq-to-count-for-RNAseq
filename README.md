# Fastq-to-count-for-RNAseq
This repository provides a robust, fully automated RNA-Seq analysis pipeline. It is designed to process raw paired-end sequencing data (FASTQ format) from start to finish, culminating in a gene-count matrix ready for downstream differential expression analysis (e.g., with DESeq2 or edgeR).
